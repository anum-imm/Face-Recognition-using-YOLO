# Face-Recognition-using-YOLO
Real-time face recognition system using YOLO for fast and accurate face detection combined with deep learning-based recognition. Ideal for identity verification and smart applications.


This project implements a real-time face recognition system using **YOLOv5** for face detection and a classification backend to identify individuals from known faces.

ðŸš€ Features

- Real-time face detection using YOLOv5
- Face recognition and attendance marking
- Multiple trained weight files (`best.pt`, `best-4.pt`, `best-6.pt`)
- Web interface built with Flask for uploading images, registering faces, and viewing attendance
